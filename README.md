# Graph-Recommendation-System
This project is a movie recommendation system implemented in C++ that uses content-based filtering on a bipartite graph. It recommends movies to a user based on their previous ratings and the genres of movies they liked. The system leverages cosine similarity to compare genre frequencies, identifies similar movies, and ranks them based on average ratings.
